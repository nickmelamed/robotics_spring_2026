# Git Primer

This primer is meant to give you a quick introduction to using version control through Git. 

This is **not** meant to teach you every piece of syntax, but rather to give you a general understanding of how to track changes in your code so that you may contribute to shared code in a productive way. 

You will learn the most amount of Git simply by **programming and using Git**. So, feel comfortable to look things up and write them down if you feel that helps you track common commands that you use in the coding you do! 

The `exercises` folder contains some quick tests to see if you understand some git basics, and the rest of the files are explanatory material.
