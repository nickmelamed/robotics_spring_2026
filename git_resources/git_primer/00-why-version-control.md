# Why Version Control Exists

Before Git, teams shared code by:
- Emailing files
- Copying folders (`final_final_v3`)
- Manually merging changes

This does not scale - at all. 

Version control solves three fundamental problems:

## 1. History
- What changed?
- When?
- Why?
- By whom?

Git stores **snapshots of your project over time**, not just files.

## 2. Collaboration
Multiple people can:
- Work simultaneously
- Avoid overwriting each other
- Review changes before merging

## 3. Safety
With Git, you can:
- Experiment without fear
- Undo mistakes
- Recover deleted work

Git is not about saving files, it is about **managing change safely**.

If you remember nothing else from this primer, remember that. Syntax can always be looked up later!
