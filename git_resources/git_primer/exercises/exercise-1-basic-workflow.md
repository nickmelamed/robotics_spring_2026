# Exercise 1: Basic Workflow

## Goal
Practice the full edit → stage → commit cycle.

## Steps
1. Create a new repo
2. Create a file `notes.txt`
3. Add text
4. Stage only part of the file
5. Commit with a clear message

## Verify
```bash
git status
git log --oneline
```

If you can explain what you committed and why, you have succeeded!
