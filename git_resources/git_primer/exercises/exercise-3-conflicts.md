# Exercise 3: Merge Conflicts (On Purpose)

## Goal
Learn that conflicts are normal and recoverable.

## Steps
1. Create two branches
2. Edit the same line differently
3. Merge
4. Resolve the conflict manually
5. Commit the resolution

## Reflection
- What was Git unable to decide?
- What information did *you* provide?

Now you're good to go with handling merge conflicts!
