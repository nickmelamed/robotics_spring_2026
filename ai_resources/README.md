## What is AI? 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has several different definitions, but a generally easier way to think about it is that it is putting human-level decision-making into computers. 

## What kind of AI is ChatGPT? 

ChatGPT, and similar models like Claude or Gemini, fall under the category of Generative AI (GenAI), because they create **original** content instead of simply recalling existing information. These are all examples of Large Language Models (LLMs) because it is trained on a large amount of human text/video/audio to learn how to do tasks. 

## Why should I care? 

If you're reading this, good chance you have had some exposure to using ChatGPT or a similar LLM. This guide is not meant to be an exhaustive explanation on LLMs/GenAI (you can save that for your Masters/PhD), but rather an intro on how to utilize these tools to better your programming abilities. 

If you ask any working professional in the tech world, there is a good chance that using GenAI in their everyday work is **mandatory** to be more productive. Learning how to use these tools will be crucial in allowing you to succeed in your professional pursuits.
