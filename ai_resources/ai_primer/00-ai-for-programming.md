# AI for Programming: What it is (and isn't)

## What AI is for Programming

AI is very good at the following tasks: 
- Explaining unfamiliar concepts 
- Generating starter code and some examples 
- Debugging by reasoning through errors 
- Refactoring code (rewriting it)
- Suggesting test cases 
- Acting as another set of eyes 

You can think of AI as an inexperienced but motivated teammate; it can give you a **ton** of volume, but it requires direction to succeed. 

## What AI is not for Programming 

AI struggles with the following: 
- Knowing your project context (unless you provide it...)
- 100% correctness (it **will** be wrong sometimes)
- Fully replacing you understanding your code 
- Guessing missing requirements 

To summarize, you cannot expect AI to read your mind and be able to figure out your project, **unless** you tell it precisely what you want it to do.

More importantly, even **if** you give it all the proper context, it **will** make mistakes. This is because GenAI models are designed to be probabilistic, not deterministic, meaning there is some randomness inherent in their outputs. The randomness is great for giving you creative answers, but inevitably leads to wrong answers too! 

And finally, don't let using GenAI models become a replacement for your learning - you will need to understand the code you are running in order to use the model better!
