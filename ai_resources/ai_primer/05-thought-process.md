# General Thought Process when Using AI 

## Checking your Work

If you are using ChatGPT, for instance, you have a history of your chats and therefore the prompts you used and the outputs it produced. It is good practice to keep track of these, as they can be a big help in figuring out why code breaks. 

Also, cite that you used an LLM if you are publishing any work. 

## Debugging Checklist 
If something is broken, some good things to have the model do are: 
- Reproduce the issue conceptually 
- Trace variable values step by step 
- Add print statements to view intermediate outputs 
- Suggest unit tests 
- Write minimal failing examples 

All of these can help structure your debugging process.

## Rules of Thumb 
- If AI output surprises you, ask why
- If code works but you don't understand it, pause, and then ask for explanation 
- If AI gives you too much output, ask it to slow down 
- If AI gives you too little, add more context 

These can help you reconfigure how you're approaching AI usage. Happy programming!
