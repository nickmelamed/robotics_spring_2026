# Git (Version Control) Standards

## What are these Standards?

These Standards are rules for us to follow when contributing to our code base. These should be followed at all times! 

## Why do we need these Standards?

We want to have consistency in our code contributions. Everyone should be able to easily see what changes have been made, why, and who made them. </br>

These standards will help us do this. These can change based on what the team deems appropriate, but the general ideas will likely remain the same.

## Branching Strategy 

## Commit Conventions

### Commit Name Conventions 


### Commit Frequency

#### Personal Branch Commit Frequency 

Since nobody else is touching this branch but you, you can frankly commmit whenever you want. Some general rules of thumb are: 

1. If you are leaving your work for an extended period of time (e.g., longer than a bathroom break), commit your code.
2. If you are stumped and find yourself needing to do more research or take some time to brainstorm, commit your code.
3. If you've completed an important step in your code (e.g., debugged an important function), commit your code.

## Pull Requests

### Pull Request Checklist 

Since this code will be changing our codebase, the rules here are going to be a little more strict. For your code to be pushed to the main branch and therefore override the existing code, you will have to create a pull request (PR) so that your changes can be approved. Below are some things that **must be done** before your PR is created. 

1. Do not commit any code that will break anything! So, you should verify that your code works **in your own branch**.
2. Only commit when you've completed important steps. Debug a function, write a new class, etc.

### Review and Label Conventions 

For any of your PRs, add INSERT NAMES OF PEOPLE TO ADD. </br>

Add a label to your PR. GitHub provides some labels to mark our PRs for better organization. The list can be found on the PR page but feel free to reference them below:

1. bug: something isn't working
2. documentation: Improvements or additions to documentation
3. duplicate: This issue or pull already exists
4. enhancement: New feature or request
5. good first issue: Good for newcomers
6. help wanted: Extra attention is needed
7. invalid: This doesn't seem right
8. question: Further information is requested
9. wontfix: This will not be worked on
