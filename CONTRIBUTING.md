# Git (Version Control) Standards

## What are these Standards?

These Standards are rules for us to follow when contributing to our code base. These should be followed at all times! 

## Why do we need these Standards?

We want to have consistency in our code contributions. Everyone should be able to easily see what changes have been made, why, and who made them. </br>

These standards will help us do this. These can change based on what the team deems appropriate, but the general ideas will likely remain the same.
